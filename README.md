# Rosetta: an opinionated research data lingua franca

## About
Rosetta aims to streamline and standardize research data migration. While excellent solutions (such as [osf.io](http://osf.ioa)) to this problem exist, they often require hosting information online, whereas with human subjects research studies additional safeguards may be mandated. Rosetta merely provides a folder structure for projects and encourages a small set of best practices.
